The first poster I liked was one about dog breed classification. Given an image of a certain breed of dog, it used neural networks to classify what breed it was. It was very cool to me because I often have trouble seeing differences between different breeds of dogs and this got up to 80 accuracy in classifying them!
Another poster I liked was about sorting and clustering songs on Spotify. It used initial songs in a user's playlists for seeded k-means to cluster more songs into playlists. It seems very useful for the ever present problem of finding more similar songs to listen to!
Finally, the third project I liked was about a Hearthstone AI. It used TD learning with Monte Carlo simulation to play Hearthstone. I found it very cool since I personally play hearthstone and was really fascinated by the techniques that the AI agent used to play the game.
